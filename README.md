# 🛒 Amazon Sales Analysis

## 🔍 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Amazon sales data to uncover insights and trends related to revenue, order priority, and regional sales distribution. By examining the dataset, the goal is to identify patterns and provide actionable insights for business decision-making.

## 📝 Objective

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data types.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore the dataset to summarize its main characteristics and identify key patterns and trends.
3. **Detailed Analysis**: Conduct deeper analysis to uncover significant relationships and insights.
4. **Visualizations**: Create comprehensive visualizations to represent findings and insights from the analysis.
5. **Additional Analysis**: Utilize advanced techniques like anomaly detection, feature engineering, and hypothesis testing to uncover further insights.

## 📄 Dataset

The project uses a dataset containing various attributes related to Amazon sales:

- **Amazon_Sales.csv**: This dataset includes detailed information on attributes like product name, order date, region, revenue, and order priority.

## 📋 Methodology

The project follows a structured approach:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:

   - Loading the dataset.
   - Inspecting the data to get an overview.
   - Handling missing values and removing duplicates.
   - Converting data types to appropriate formats.
   - Standardizing column names for consistency.
   - Detecting and handling outliers.
   - Normalizing or standardizing data for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

   - Analyzing the distribution of key variables such as revenue, order priority, and region.
   - Investigating the relationships between different attributes in the dataset.

3. **Detailed Analysis**:
